# QField ORS Routing Plugin

This [QField](https://qfield.org) plugin enables users to retrieve
the shortest paths between two points and display the journey on top of their
map canvas.

The plugin is based on the [QField OSRM plugin](https://github.com/opengisch/qfield-osrm), but replaces the routing backend with [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/). ORS provides a rich set of routing profiles and global coverage.

# Installation

To install the plugin, [download the plugin from the releases page](https://github.com/opengisch/qfield-ors/releases/tag/v1.0)
and follow the [plugin installation guide](https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/plugins/#application-plugins).
